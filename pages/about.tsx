              Hey it's Yahya! I'm 19 years old from Turkey and a visual communication design student. I love creating 3D designs, models,
              animations and objects and this is my passion. And i keep improving myself.
            </p>
            <p className="text-md !line-p font-inter font-medium text-87 lg:text-lg tracking-tight">
              I don't know if you know but I can't make money off these designs because I'm doing this for myself, not as a private
              business. It has become my hobby. That's why I opened this site to make money from my hobbies. So enjoy!
