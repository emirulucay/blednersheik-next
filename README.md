[@emir](https://twitter.com/astrodokki) works in sales and web design, while  [@yahya](https://twitter.com/yahyarsen) is the person who designs 3b models. Therefore, Yahya is an important member of the company.


## Models

Yahya is interested in model studies. He usually comes up with the ideas as well. Only custom models are made through special orders. Emir is responsible for the ordering process.

## Special Collections

Special Collections are the products that we label as our favorite ones made under the Blendersheik brand. These products are sold at a slightly higher price, but they are definitely worth every penny.
